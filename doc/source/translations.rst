Translating AgenDAV
===================

AgenDAV translation system is based on labels which get translated into
full sentences/paragraphs. They can contain placeholders which get replaced
by the system depending on the context.

How to add a translation
------------------------
Access `AgenDAV project in Transifex 
<https://www.transifex.com/adobo/agendav/>`_ and use the 
*Create language_* to add the missing language. You'll have to wait 
until I approve the request. Once you have it created, you'll be able 
to use Transifex interface to translate AgenDAV strings.
